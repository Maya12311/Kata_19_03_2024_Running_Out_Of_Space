# Kata_19_03_2024_Running_Out_Of_Space

DESCRIPTION:
Kevin is noticing his space run out! Write a function that removes the spaces from the values and returns an array showing the space decreasing.
For example, running this function on the array ['i', 'have','no','space'] would produce ['i','ihave','ihaveno','ihavenospace']
